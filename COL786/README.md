**Course ID:** COL786

**Experience:** Prof. Rahul Garg is a very sweet professor who tries to change topics only once everyone seems to have understood it. He is very resourceful too. 
**Teaching:** Quite flexible deadlines and the teaching style is mentioned above.
**Grading Style:** Minors was graded with sir's rubrics so it was quite fair. The rest we'll get to know once the semester ends.
**Career:** I got a certain amount of interest towards academia/research which I used to loathe earlier. I think I'll consider continuing under Prof. Garg.

**Course ID:** COL786
**Semester:** 2302
**Professor:** Rahul Garg
**Experience:** Great experience. Got hands on experience with fMRI scanning. A lot of critical thinking involved in paper as well as in class. Pre minor was mostly cognitive science dominated, post minor was statistics - so serves both the tastes. It is not a ML course - we learn about estimation theory to estimate model parameters but we do not train models or build such. It is more about stats than ML. 
**Teaching:** Sir has a genuine interest in teaching the course, making it enjoyable for students as well. He is quite considerate with deadlines and flexible too about it. All necessary resources and help is provided from his side. 
**Grading Style:** Pre minor we got tons of home works on ted ed videos on exceptional brain discoveries, but later assignments took their place. 10% marks reduction for every late submission. Gradescope submissions. There is a mid term presentation - with prof and peer review; marks assigned based on ur literature review and action plan for the project. Exams are doable - involves design choice questions and theory. And mathematics for estimation. Signal processing basics like LTI and all are expected for the course. And MTL106 as well. Evaluations are fair. 
**Career:** The project I am doing for the course has an impact on the CV. It does interest people into learning more about me. Possibly might have an impact if u r looking towards a neuroscience career. Cs people do find a place here in building statistical models for understanding brain connectivity and functioning. 
**Rating:** 5
**Stage:** 4th Sem;5th Sem;6th Sem;7th-8th Sem
