# Department Electives Review Database

## Overview

The Department Electives Review Database is a collection of reviews provided by students for CSE departmental elective courses. These reviews offer valuable insights and experiences that can aid students in making informed decisions about their elective selections. We plan to expand it to other departments if we get a good response for this initiative.

## Contributing Reviews

If you're a student who has taken an elective course and would like to contribute your experience to the database, please fill out the [Elective Course Review Form](https://forms.gle/1VKBcrjKTzQJrhig6).
